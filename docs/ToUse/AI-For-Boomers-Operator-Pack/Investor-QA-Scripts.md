# Investor Q&A Response Scripts

## 1) Why you?
**Answer structure:** credibility + insight + obsession
- We’re building a reliability system, not a novelty assistant.
- The wedge is caregiver reassurance with measurable outcomes.
- We optimize for trust and daily-use retention.

## 2) What’s the wedge?
- Private family reassurance and escalation around routines (appointments/meds).
- Once embedded in daily routines, churn drops dramatically.

## 3) Why now?
- AI speech + agent tooling is mature enough for a voice-first UX.
- Caregiver burnout and aging population pressure are increasing.

## 4) How do you acquire users?
- Caregiver viral loop: reassurance moments → invite caregiver → referral.
- B2B2C pilots with senior living/home care/MA plans.
- App store presence for direct-to-consumer.

## 5) What’s pricing and willingness to pay?
- Caregivers pay for peace of mind.
- Tiers: Plus (individual), Family (caregiver), Premium (enterprise features).
- Annual prepay improves retention and cash flow.

## 6) Competition?
- Generic reminder apps and voice assistants aren’t reliability systems.
- We differentiate on: escalation, auditability, accessibility, privacy posture.

## 7) Liability / regulatory risk?
- We are healthcare-adjacent: no diagnosis, no treatment.
- Consent-first, no public health sharing, strong access controls.
- Architecture supports HIPAA alignment if required by partners.

## 8) Unit economics?
- Key costs: AI inference + notifications.
- Mitigation: caching, tiered usage, batching reminders, multi-channel optimization.
- Target gross margin: 70–80% at scale.

## 9) What traction do you have / will you show?
- Pilot metrics: reminder success rate, adherence lift, caregiver NPS.
- Funnel: invite-to-activate caregiver, conversion to paid.

## 10) What do you need money for?
- Reliability + compliance hardening
- Pilot execution and partnerships
- GTM experiments and conversion optimization
- Hiring: backend reliability, mobile, partnerships, support ops

## 11) What’s the 18-month plan?
- 0–6: pilots + reliability + caregiver loop
- 6–12: enterprise expansion + monetization
- 12–18: scaled distribution + HIPAA-aligned option if demanded

## 12) What can kill this?
- Reminder reliability failures
- Trust issues (privacy missteps)
- Distribution misalignment
**Mitigation:** engineering rigor + privacy pledge + B2B2C distribution focus.
